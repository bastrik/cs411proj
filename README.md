# stacksity

This is the main stacksity repository. Code here will **must** be production ready and will be moved directly from `master` into our production enviroment.

## How often does this thing deploy?
We don't automatically deploy. Ping `@tylerhan` on Slack and he can do it for you. If there is a disaster and Tyler is sleeping on vaction, you can ping `@noah` and he can deploy for you.

## How do I test locally?
We use XAMPP to do our local testing. There are some bugs, but for the most part, things hold together. You can download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.

## Application Repos
If you need added to a repository, use `#requests` on Slack.
