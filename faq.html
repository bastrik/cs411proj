        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>Stacksity is a site about everything and anything. You follow stacks (topics) and other users that provide content and news updates. You also have the power to share links, text, and images with your friends and with the world. Discuss issues, read news, or just show your friends something funny. Most importantly, vote your favorites to the top of the stack! Through followers you can reach an even wider audience, and keep in touch with friends and colleagues.</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why Stacksity?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>
                For most people, there will be many parallels drawn Stacksity and other sites. Sites such as reddit, tumblr, 9gag, instagram come to mind very quickly. Stacksity is entirely unique, as we take into consideration all the individual factors we like and dislike about social networks, evaluate them, and put them together to provide for the best user experience. Currently, Stacksity is unique in that it lets you follow and receive information from not only users, but specific topics and forums contributed by the entire community. By diversifying content through links, texts, and images, a easy, scrollable format allows for users on mobile devices and desktops alike to have a clean and straightforward session. <br><br>

                Finally, at Stacksity we value your own privacy and freedom of speech. Beyond blatantly illegal content such as child pornography or the obstruction of justice, we will tolerate all opinions and beliefs regardless of context, with absolutely no biases towards any ideologies or philosophies, and will only intervene with reasonable motives should there be legal issues. As for privacy, we respect all content hosted by the user and will never under any circumstance sell or distribute it. Only you will be entitled to your posts and comment history, as no one else can see the comprehensive list of it through the site.

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I make a stack?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>Making a stack is easy, simply visit the url: stacksity.com/$<i>(your stack name here)</i> and the stack will automatically be generated for you. Remember to precede the stack name with a <b>$ sign</b>, and ensure the your new stack’s name contains no spaces or special characters.</p>
        </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
    </li>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do stacks work?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>Stacks that are not users start with a <b>$ sign</b>. When you visit a stack you’ll first see the top posts users have submitted to the stack. You can weigh in on what you think is the most deserving content by <b>upstacking</b> and <b>downstacking</b> any post using the up and down arrows to the left.</p>
        </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
    </li>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I post?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>
                As a user, you can either post in a targeted stack (preceded by the <b>$ sign</b>), on another user’s wall, or on your own wall. At the top of each stack, there is a posting form. Simply choose the type of post (text,link or image) and enter a title. Finally, hit the post button below to make the post. On posts to users’ stacks there is also a private button if you want the post only to be visible to yourself and the other user.
            </p>
        </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
    </li>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I remove a post?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>There is a delete button below each post you make. To delete your post just click the delete button, a window will then pop up prompting you to confirm the action.</p>
        </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
    </li>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I follow/unfollow?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>At the top of each stack page besides your own, there will be a blue/white button that says either “follow” or “unfollow.”</p>
        </div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
    </li>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who moderates Stacksity?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>Stacksity is moderated solely by site-wide admins. We’ve opted out of giving moderation rights to the creators of stacks to ensure no misuse from the would-be moderators. The philosophy behind this is that moderation simply depends on who gets to the Stack first, and they may drive the stack to their biases. Instead admins will remove illegal content but ensure stacks are driven by user input and preference. In the future we will implement admin action logs to further enforce transparency in the process.
                <br><br>
                The current admins are: <a href="https://stacksity.com/u/1">@karthus</a>, <a href="https://stacksity.com/u/26">@paris</a>,<a href="https://stacksity.com/u/1470">@adminR</a>, <a href="https://stacksity.com/u/3">@younglee</a> and <a href="https://stacksity.com/u/829">@garfonzo</a>.</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I report bugs/request features?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>For now we’re referring people to the <a href="https://stacksity.com/$discuss">$discuss</a> stack. There you can give us your input on the state of the website, report issues you may encounter as well as request features to be added in the near future. We may also make import announcements there from time to time.</p>

            <p>Posts made to your stack by others, or by yourself to your own stack ($self) will show up in your followers’ UserStack and TopStack feed. Followers of non-user stacks will see posts to that stack on their TopStack</p>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I tag users/stacks?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>To tag another user, simply type @<i>(user’s name)</i> in your comment. They will receive a notification that you tagged them in your comment. You can also tag stacks by typing $<i>(stack’s name)</i>, this will then link to the stack in question when users click on it.</p>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who can see private posts on my stack?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>If someone makes a private post on your stack, just you and the poster and able to see it. Similarly, if you post a private post to your own stack only you will be able to see it. Keep in mind: private posts cannot be retroactively made public.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>
                NSFW is an acronym for <i>“<b>N</b>ot <b>S</b>afe <b>F</b>or <b>W</b>ork”</i>, which refers to content that should not be seen at work or in a public setting. Posts marked with this are usually <b>pornographic</b> in nature, with <b>nudity</b> being the primary type. Other types of NSFW include <b>extreme gore</b> that makes people disgusted, obvious profanity, and racism/other <b>extremely offensive content</b>.

            <p>Under settings in the top bar (if you are logged in, click <a href='/settings'>here</a>), you will be able to see a toggle switch next to the NSFW option. If you are 18 and have it turned on, you will be able to see all NSFW posts anywhere on Stacksity (newstack, topstack, allstack, userstack).</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do NSFW Stacks work?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>If a stack is designated as NSFW, it will have a red colored banner, and all <i>“safe”</i> posts on it will automatically get marked as <i>“nsfw”</i>, while other types of nsfw will keep their type. If you are logged out or you don’t have NSFW turned on, you will prompted over am <i>”are you over 18”</i> dialog before you enter. If you enter no, you will be redirected back to $topstack. For those with NSFW turned out, you will be able to easily enter the stack.</p>

    <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I make a NSFW post?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>You can only make NSFW posts if you have NSFW turned on, or on a NSFW stack. If you have NSFW turned on, in the post box you will see a small dropdown menu what has 4 options: <b>“safe, nsfw, gore, nudity”</b>. <b>Safe</b> means that the post is safe for viewing by everyone in almost all places. <b>nsfw</b> is a catch-all for all types of nsfw posts. <b>gore</b> refers to graphic images (entrails, visible internal organs, etc.). <b>nudity</b> refers to visible private organs or anything of pornographic nature. Please tag your posts appropriately or you will receive warning from the admins.</p>

            <p>Yes there is an app coming out for iOS, android, and windows devices. It is currently still under development, with some minor bug fixes and components left. Due to the approval process required to publish on the Apple appstore, it is likely that the iOS version will be delayed slightly.
                <br><br>
                The current edition of the app is running on PhoneGap, but over the summer we have assembled a team to work in both Swift and Java for the respective native versions of iOS and Android.</p>

                <br><br>
                If your mobile device lags or gives you display errors, it is likely that your operating system or hardware is not completely up to date. The app will provide for a smoother experience in this case.</p>
